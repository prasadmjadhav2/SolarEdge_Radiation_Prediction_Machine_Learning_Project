# SolarEdge Radiation Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Overview

I am excited to share my recent work on **Solar Radiation Prediction** using data science and machine learning techniques. This project leverages various tools and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, and optuna.

## Key Highlights

- **Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset containing 32,686 entries with features such as UNIXTime, Data, Time, Radiation, Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Wind Direction, Speed, TimeSunRise, and TimeSunSet.

- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps including handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

- **Modeling**: Implemented **XGBoost Regressor** for predictive modeling, optimizing hyperparameters using **Optuna** to enhance model performance.

- **Evaluation**: Achieved a high R-squared score, showcasing the model's accuracy in predicting solar radiation.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, optuna

- **Data Visualization**: Used seaborn and matplotlib for insightful visualizations

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model performance using metrics like **r2_score**

## Conclusion

This project aims to predict solar radiation, which is crucial for optimizing solar energy generation and improving the efficiency of solar panels. I am proud of the results and the insights gained from this project.
